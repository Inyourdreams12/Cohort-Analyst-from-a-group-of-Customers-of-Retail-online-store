# From First Purchase to Loyal Customer | Cohort Analysis of User Retention in Online Retail

This presentation focus on how online retailers can use cohort analysis to understand user retention rates and identify factors that contribute to customer loyalty. This would dive into how to Calculate the retention rate: The retention rate is the percentage of customers from a given cohort who make a repeat purchase.

In your case, I have chosen to analyze a 13-month cohort from Dec 2010 - Dec 2011, which means that im tracking how a group of users or customers who first made a purchase in December 2010 and ending with December 2011 behave over the next 13 months. This can help to understand how loyal or valuable this cohort is, as well as identify factors that influence their behavior.

<br />

Based on the retention rates i got, it seems that the December 2010 cohort had a higher retention rate than the cohort that began making purchases in January 2011.

The first month's retention rate for both cohorts is 100%, which means that all users or customers who made a purchase in December 2010 and January 2011 made another purchase in the following month. 
However, in the second month, the retention rate for the January 2011 cohort is only 22%, while the retention rate for the December 2010 cohort is 36%. This suggests that the December 2010 cohort is more loyal or engaged with the product or service than the January 2011 cohort.

Over the next several months, the retention rates for both cohorts fluctuate, with some months showing an increase in retention and others showing a decline. Interestingly, both cohorts experience a sharp drop in retention in month 12 (November 2011), with the December 2010 cohort dropping from 50% to 27% and the January 2011 cohort dropping from 37% to 12%.

The fact that both cohorts experience a similar drop in retention in the same month suggests that there may be an external factor at play, such as a holiday or other event that caused users or customers to be less active during that time period.

The cohort table with numeric values allows us see the absolute number of users or customers in each cohort, which can provide valuable insights into the overall size and growth of the user base. 

The number of users declines over time, which is a common trend in cohort analysis. This could be due to various reasons, such as users losing interest in the product, finding a better alternative, or other factors.

Cohorts 2-5 (January-April 2011) have a similar retention rate, while cohorts 6-9 (May-August 2011) also have similar retention rates. This suggests that there may be some underlying patterns or factors that are affecting retention rates for these groups of users.

The retention rate for cohort 10 (September 2011) is significantly higher than the previous few cohorts. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as an improvement in the product or service, targeted marketing efforts, or other factors.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
   + Investigating the factors that led to the higher retention rate for cohort 10, and replicating these strategies for future cohorts.
   + Improving the onboarding process for new users, to help ensure that they have a positive first experience with the Sale service.
   + Considering implementing a loyalty or rewards program to incentivize users to continue using the product or service over time.
